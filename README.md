# Environment:
Python 3.7
Tensorflow 1.15.0

# Text Editor
Jupyter Notebook

# Analysis and Training
Import modules, dataset, preprocess the data, remove non essential words using Inverse Document Frequence (threshold) and training the
model using deep neural networks or svm (commented out).

# Testing
testing.ipynb works for manual comments.
real_time_sentiment_analysis_from_streaming_data.ipynb works for streaming twitter data for hastags and followed
by graphical representations.
